		<h1>Coronavirus: The Indian children orphaned by Covid-19</h1>
		<img src="img/IndianChildren.jpg"/>
		<p>
		Five-year-old Pratham and his 10-month-old brother Ayush lost their father 
		to Covid in April. Days later, at a different Delhi hospital, they lost their 
		mother.
		</p>
		<p>Their world had changed and they didn't even know it. They couldn't
		understand why their parents were taking so long to come home. Relatives 
		told Pratham that his mum and dad had gone out for work. But Pratham
		kept asking, and each day became more difficult than the last.
		</p>
		<p>The relatives decided to contact a Delhi-based non-governmental 
		organisation (NGO) that works with orphaned children. The NGO says it hopes 
		someone will adopt both Pratham and his brother.
		</p>
		<p>
		Sonia, 12, and her brother Amit, 7, lost their father in the first wave of the pandemic
		in June last year and their mother in April this year. Their paternal 
		grandmother is looking after them at the moment. She is worried about their
		future, but doesn't even want to consider registering them for adoption.
		</p>
		<p>"Who will look after these kids after me?" she said. "These children are the
		legacy of my son and daughter-in-law. A lot of people are coming to ask for
		adoption. How can I give them away?"
		</p>
		<p>These are not isolated stories. Covid has devastated families across India, 
		orphaning many children.
		</p>
		<p>
		Smirti Irani, minister for women and child welfare, recently tweeted that both 
		parents of at least 577 children had died with coronavirus between 1 April and 
		25 May. Experts say this number is likely a significant underestimate.
